<h1>Percy Jackson and the Olympians</h1>
<p>Percy finally turns 16</p>
<p>The Great Prophecy says that when he turns 16 a <del>great war shall fall</del></p>
<p>That's exactly<abbr>what happened</abbr></p>
<footer>Percy knows he will have to fight against Kronos soon </footer>
<h3> So, Percy took a dip in the <mark>River Styx</mark> which makes him imortal</h3>
<h4> He can only be killed from <small class="text-muted">the small of his back</small> his only invulnerable spot</h4>
<h4 class="display-4">And the war begins with typhon storming around the world and the gods trying to defeat the giant</h4>
